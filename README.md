LOANS are the major requirement of the modern world. By this only, 
Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage 
their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like 
houses, cars, etc.
But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be 
granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.
So, here we will be using Machine Learning with Python to ease their work and 
predict whether the candidate’s profile is relevant or not using key features like 
Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.
The process of loan approval is pivotal in the financial industry, shaping the 
interaction between lenders and borrowers. In recent years, the integration of 
machine learning techniques has revolutionized this process, offering automated 
and efficient solutions. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of 
prominent machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Support Vector 
Classification, KNeighborsClassifiers and Random Forest, for loan approval 
prediction
